# Academic Workflow Project Planner Documentation

## Background and Motivation
This project aims to automate and streamline the academic paper writing process through a six-stage workflow, leveraging AI, citation network analysis, and multi-source research. The goal is to reduce manual effort, improve research quality, and maintain academic rigor, all within a cost-effective, single-user, local deployment environment.

The next milestone is to upgrade the `/api/outline` endpoint from a stub to a real AI-powered academic outline generator using Claude 3.5 Sonnet via the Anthropic SDK. This must strictly follow the TDD protocol as defined in `.tdd-rules-cursor.md`.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
- Securely handling the Anthropic API key (never commit to repo)
- Parsing multipart/form-data for prompt and optional files
- Handling API errors, rate limits, and timeouts gracefully
- Ensuring response structure is always academic and well-formed
- Maintaining test coverage and passing all existing tests
- Adhering to strict TDD and .tdd-rules-cursor.md protocols
- Ensuring response time is < 30s and cost per outline is tracked
- Properly mocking or skipping environment-dependent tests

## High-level Task Breakdown (Claude 3.5 Sonnet Integration)
- [ ] **TDD: Write failing tests for /api/outline**
  - Success: Tests fail, clearly describe expected behavior (see Test Scenarios)
- [ ] **Install and configure Anthropic SDK**
  - Success: `@anthropic-ai/sdk` present in dependencies, imported in endpoint
- [ ] **Add ANTHROPIC_API_KEY to .env and .env.example**
  - Success: Key is loaded from environment, never committed
- [ ] **Parse prompt and files from POST requests (multipart/form-data)**
  - Success: Endpoint extracts prompt and files, returns 400 if missing
- [ ] **Call Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet API**
  - Success: Endpoint calls Claude with academic system prompt, receives outline
- [ ] **Format and return academic outline**
  - Success: Outline is string, well-structured (I., II., III.), academic tone
- [ ] **Track/log token usage and cost**
  - Success: Usage/cost info included in response (stub or real)
- [ ] **Comprehensive error handling**
  - Success: Handles missing key, API errors, rate limits, timeouts, returns user-friendly errors
- [ ] **Update/expand integration tests for edge/error cases**
  - Success: Tests cover valid, invalid, and error scenarios
- [ ] **Test coverage report**
  - Success: Coverage report generated, all tests pass

## Test Scenarios (Claude 3.5 Sonnet Integration)
- Returns 400 for missing prompt
- Returns 200 and outline for valid prompt (with/without files)
- Outline is string, well-structured, academic tone
- Handles file uploads (PDF, DOCX, invalid types)
- Handles missing API key (500 error)
- Handles Claude API errors, rate limits, and timeouts
- Tracks and returns usage and cost information in the response (stub or real)
- All tests pass, coverage is adequate

**READY FOR TASK 3**: Test structure refactoring and optimization

## Previous Updates
- All /api/generate endpoint tests now pass (except the E2E placeholder). Minimal LLM integration logic is in place, with error handling and usage reporting. Next step: expand content generation and citation logic for multiple sections and references, and implement reference linking/validation.
- Starting Executor mode: Integrating WorkflowUI into the main page as the first subtask. Will begin by writing a failing test for the presence of WorkflowUI on the landing page.

## Lessons
- Always run `npx vitest` directly if no npm test script is present.
- Only implement the minimal code to pass the current failing test in each TDD cycle.
- API rate limits and timeouts can cause test failures; consider stubbing or increasing timeouts for TDD.
- Use xml2js for parsing ArXiv XML responses.
- Implement citation formatting logic for both APA and MLA styles.

## Current Status / Progress Tracking
- [x] Dependencies installed (xml2js, node-fetch)
- [x] Test timeouts updated to 30s
- [x] Citation formatting fixed
- [x] Multi-source integration working
- [x] Error handling implemented
- [x] Cost calculation added

# Test Results for /api/research

# Lessons
- Only APA 7 citation format is supported, regardless of request
- Error messages for all sources are always included in response.errors (null if no error)
- Multi-source tests are tolerant to real API failures or rate limits

# Project Status Board
- [x] /api/research endpoint: All requirements and tests complete

# Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
- All requirements for /api/research endpoint are now complete and all tests pass. Ready for manual verification or next feature.

### Endpoint
POST /api/generate

### Request Body (application/json)
{
  outline: [
    { section: string, content: string }, // Required, at least one section
    ...
  ],
  references: [
    { id: string|number, citation: string, authors: string[], year: number, title: string, source: string }, // Required, at least one reference
    ...
  ]
}

### Response (200 OK)
{
  content: string, // Full academic text, with in-text citations (APA 7)
  usage: {
    tokens: number, // Total tokens used (LLM call)
    cost: number    // Cost in USD (LLM call)
  },
  references: [

# Academic Workflow UI Integration Planning

## Background and Motivation
The project automates academic paper writing through a 6-stage AI workflow. Stages 1-3 (outline, research, content generation) are implemented and tested at the API level. The next priority is to integrate these endpoints into a seamless, user-friendly UI that guides users through the complete academic paper generation process, including citation management and export features.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
- Ensuring smooth, stateful progression through outline â†’ research â†’ content generation
- Robust error handling and user feedback for AI/API failures
- Managing and validating citations and references in the UI
- Supporting export features (PDF, Word, BibTeX)
- Maintaining strict TDD and test coverage for all UI components and workflow logic
- Responsive, accessible, and modern UI/UX with Tailwind CSS
- Integrating with existing authentication/session management

## High-level Task Breakdown
1. **Design Multi-Step Workflow UI**
   - Success: User can progress through prompt input â†’ outline â†’ research â†’ content generation in a guided, stepwise interface
   - Test: UI renders each step, disables/enables navigation appropriately, and displays correct state
2. **Implement State Management**
   - Success: All data (prompt, outline, research, content, references) is tracked and passed between steps
   - Test: State persists across navigation, resets on new workflow, and is isolated per user session
3. **Integrate API Endpoints**
   - Success: UI calls /api/outline, /api/research, /api/generate in correct sequence, handles loading and errors
   - Test: Mock API responses, verify correct data flow and error handling
4. **Citation Management UI**
   - Success: User can view, edit, and validate references; in-text citations are linked to references
   - Test: All citations in generated content match references, UI highlights mismatches
5. **Export Features**
   - Success: User can export paper as PDF, Word, and BibTeX
   - Test: Exported files contain correct content and references
6. **E2E Workflow Integration Test**
   - Success: Full workflow (prompt â†’ outline â†’ research â†’ content â†’ export) passes E2E test
   - Test: Simulate user journey, verify all steps and outputs
7. **UI/UX Polish and Accessibility**
   - Success: Responsive, accessible, and visually appealing interface
   - Test: Manual and automated accessibility checks, responsive design tests

- Next: Refactor /api/outline integration if needed, then proceed to /api/research integration (write failing test first).

## Lessons
- Reference .tdd-rules-cursor.md for all TDD cycles
- Always read and test API endpoints before UI integration
- Maintain strict TypeScript and ESLint compliance

## Current TDD Cycle
- [ ] RED: Write failing test for API integration and state management in WorkflowUI (outline, research, generate, error/loading states)
- [ ] Run test - confirm failure
- [ ] GREEN: Implement robust API integration and state management
