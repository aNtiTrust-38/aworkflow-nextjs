## Architecture Overview

### Multi-LLM AI Provider System
- **Intelligent Routing**: `lib/ai-providers/router.ts` automatically selects optimal provider (Claude vs GPT-4o) based on task type
- **Provider Classes**: Each provider (`anthropic.ts`, `openai.ts`) extends base class with unified interface
- **Failover**: Automatic provider switching if one fails
- **Budget Tracking**: Real-time cost monitoring with configurable monthly limits

### Security & Settings Architecture  
- **Encrypted Storage**: AES-256-GCM encryption for API keys and sensitive data (`lib/crypto.ts`, `lib/encryption-service.ts`)
- **Settings Management**: Centralized user settings with GUI dashboard (`components/SettingsDashboard.tsx`)
- **Setup Wizard**: 4-step guided configuration for new users (`components/SetupWizard.tsx`)
- **Database**: Prisma ORM with SQLite (dev) - schema includes User, UserSettings, Paper, Reference models

### Workflow System
- **6-Step Process**: PROMPT ‚Üí GOALS ‚Üí RESEARCH ‚Üí GENERATE ‚Üí REFINE ‚Üí EXPORT
- **Main Component**: `src/app/WorkflowUI.tsx` orchestrates entire academic workflow
- **Dynamic Loading**: Heavy components lazy-loaded for performance
- **ADHD-Friendly**: Reduced cognitive load, clear visual hierarchy, accessible navigation

### Component Architecture
- **Command Palette**: VS Code-inspired fuzzy search interface (`components/CommandPalette.tsx`)
- **Navigation**: Responsive stepper with keyboard shortcuts (`components/Navigation.tsx`)
- **Citation Management**: Integration with Zotero API for reference sync (`src/app/CitationManager.tsx`)
- **Export System**: PDF/Word generation with proper formatting (`lib/export/`)

### Testing Strategy
- **Vitest Framework**: Comprehensive test coverage across all layers
- **Component Testing**: React Testing Library for UI components
- **API Testing**: Supertest for endpoint validation
- **Security Testing**: Encryption and settings storage validation
- **Accessibility Testing**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance verification

## Key Implementation Patterns

### API Provider Usage
```typescript
// Use the AI router for intelligent provider selection
import { AIRouter } from 'lib/ai-providers/router';
const router = new AIRouter();
const response = await router.generateContent(prompt, 'research'); // Auto-selects Claude for research
```

### Settings Access
```typescript
// Always use encrypted settings storage
import { UserSettingsStorage } from 'lib/user-settings-storage';
const settings = await UserSettingsStorage.getSettings(userId);
```

### Database Operations
```typescript
// Use Prisma client for all database operations
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';
const prisma = new PrismaClient();
```

### Error Handling
- Use `ErrorMessage` component for user-facing errors
- Implement proper loading states with `LoadingSpinner`
- Follow fail-safe patterns (don't block app functionality)

## Development Guidelines

### Required Testing
- Write tests for all new AI provider integrations
- Test encryption/decryption for any settings-related code
- Validate accessibility with keyboard navigation tests
- Test responsive design across viewport sizes

### Security Requirements
- Never log or expose API keys in console/errors
- Use encryption service for all sensitive data storage
- Validate API keys before storage using test endpoints
- Implement proper CORS and authentication checks

### Performance Considerations
- Use dynamic imports for heavy components
- Implement proper loading states for async operations
- Cache expensive computations where appropriate
- Monitor AI provider costs and usage

### Accessibility Standards
- Maintain WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Support keyboard navigation with arrow keys and shortcuts
- Provide screen reader announcements for state changes
- Ensure minimum 44px touch targets for mobile

## Inviolate Rules for Development
1) Before each phase of development read:
    1) nextsteps.md
    2) README.md
    3) Logging documentation
    4) Changelog
    **STOP AND WAIT FOR USER APPROVAL BEFORE PROCEEDING TO RULE 2**

2) NO DEVELOPMENT WILL HAPPEN NOW, THIS IS JUST FOR PLANNING PURPOSES.
    1) Use subagents to verify details or investigate any blockers in development.
    2) Use subagents to investigate questions you may have related to development in a conversation or task.
    **STOP AND WAIT FOR USER APPROVAL BEFORE PROCEEDING TO RULE 3**

3) Think hard about and make a plan for how to address blockers in development. If there are no blockers think about and design a plan to move from the current stage of development to the next. If there is no development plan ultrathink of a plan and design one. And plan written should be appended to instructions.md (make it if it doesn't exist and ensure that it is up to date if it does.) and immediate next steps will be written into nextsteps.md (replacing the content and including a summary of development).
    **STOP AND WAIT FOR USER APPROVAL BEFORE PROCEEDING TO RULE 4**

4) Create tests that will meet the plan developed in step 3. At this phase **NO** implementation will be done. This is strictly designing the RED phase of our TDD methodology.
    **STOP AND WAIT FOR USER APPROVAL BEFORE PROCEEDING TO RULE 5**

5) Implement your solutions in code to pass the existing tests. The GREEN phase - **NO** tests can be changed. Code must be implemented to pass the existing tests. (Verify the reasonability of the solution as it goes. Our goal is efficiency of code. We don't want to over-engineer our solution.)
    - After each green test verify that the solution has actually been implemented.
    **STOP AND WAIT FOR USER APPROVAL BEFORE PROCEEDING TO RULE 6**

6) commit the result and create a pull request (if necessary and relevant). update README.md and the changelog.
    **STOP AND WAIT FOR USER APPROVAL AFTER COMPLETING THIS RULE**

## Coding Rules
1) Write tests based on expected input/output pairs.
    1) We are operating in a TDD best practice mode.
2) Run tests to confirm that they fail.
    1) Do not not write any implementation code at this stage
3) Commit the tests when you're satisfied with them.
4) Write code that passes the tests
    1) Do not modify the tests.
    2) Keep going until all tests pass.
    3) Use subagents to ensure that implementation isn't overfitting the tests.
5) Once satisfied with the code (and approved by me) always commit the code.

## Inviolate Rules
- **All code browsing, internet access, and file operations should run through puppeteer mcp.**

## TDD Guidelines
- **Red Phase Guidelines**:
  - step 5 is the green phase and **NO** test can me changed. Code must be implemented to pass the existing test.
  - **Subagents should be used to ensure that RED tests (Rule 4) are efficient**

## Additional Guidelines
- Another inviolate rule: At the end of each development phase (when a phase of the plan is completed) Update documentation and explicitly echo to the user what the next stage is. Ensure that nextsteps.md is explicitly notated that the phase is complete.
