## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in the Academic Workflow Assistant, please report it responsibly.

### How to Report

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. Send an email to [security@academicworkflow.com] with:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Any suggested fixes (optional)

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: We'll acknowledge your report within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: We'll provide an initial assessment within 7 days
- **Updates**: We'll keep you informed of our progress
- **Resolution**: Critical vulnerabilities will be addressed within 30 days
- **Credit**: We'll credit you in our security advisories (unless you prefer anonymity)

## Security Measures

### Application Security

- **Authentication**: Secure session management with NextAuth.js
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- **Output Encoding**: XSS prevention through proper encoding
- **CSRF Protection**: Built-in CSRF protection
- **SQL Injection**: Prisma ORM provides built-in protection

### Infrastructure Security

- **HTTPS**: All communications encrypted in transit
- **Security Headers**: Comprehensive security headers implemented
- **Rate Limiting**: API endpoints protected against abuse
- **Container Security**: Docker containers run as non-root users
- **Secrets Management**: Environment variables for sensitive data

### Data Protection

- **Encryption at Rest**: Sensitive data encrypted using AES-256-GCM
- **Encryption in Transit**: TLS 1.2+ for all communications
- **Key Management**: Secure key rotation and management
- **Data Minimization**: Only necessary data is collected and stored
- **Access Controls**: Principle of least privilege

### API Security

- **API Keys**: Secure storage and rotation of API keys
- **Request Validation**: All API requests validated
- **Error Handling**: No sensitive information in error responses
- **Logging**: Security events logged for monitoring
- **Monitoring**: Real-time security monitoring and alerting

## Security Best Practices for Users

### For End Users

1. **Strong Passwords**: Use strong, unique passwords
2. **API Key Security**: Never share or commit API keys to version control
3. **Regular Updates**: Keep the application updated
4. **Secure Environment**: Run on trusted infrastructure
5. **Monitor Access**: Regularly review access logs

### For Developers

1. **Code Review**: All code changes reviewed for security implications
2. **Dependency Updates**: Regular dependency updates and vulnerability scanning
3. **Secure Coding**: Follow OWASP secure coding guidelines
4. **Testing**: Include security testing in development process
5. **Documentation**: Keep security documentation updated

## Security Testing

We employ multiple layers of security testing:

- **Static Analysis**: Automated code analysis for vulnerabilities
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular scanning of third-party dependencies
- **Container Scanning**: Docker image vulnerability scanning
- **Dynamic Testing**: OWASP ZAP security testing
- **Penetration Testing**: Annual third-party security assessments

## Compliance

The Academic Workflow Assistant is designed with the following compliance considerations:

- **GDPR**: Data protection and privacy by design
- **SOC 2**: Security controls and procedures
- **ISO 27001**: Information security management
- **OWASP Top 10**: Protection against common web vulnerabilities

## Security Architecture

### Defense in Depth

1. **Perimeter Security**: Firewall and network controls
2. **Application Security**: Secure coding and validation
3. **Data Security**: Encryption and access controls
4. **Monitoring**: Logging and real-time monitoring
5. **Incident Response**: Prepared response procedures

### Security Controls

| Control Type | Implementation |
|--------------|----------------|
| Authentication | Multi-factor authentication support |
| Authorization | Role-based access control (RBAC) |
| Encryption | AES-256-GCM for data at rest |
| Transport Security | TLS 1.2+ for data in transit |
| Input Validation | Server-side validation for all inputs |
| Output Encoding | Context-aware output encoding |
| Error Handling | Secure error messages |
| Logging | Comprehensive security event logging |
| Monitoring | Real-time security monitoring |
| Backup | Encrypted backups with integrity checks |

## Incident Response

In case of a security incident:

1. **Detection**: Automated monitoring and alerting
2. **Assessment**: Rapid impact assessment
3. **Containment**: Immediate containment measures
4. **Eradication**: Root cause analysis and remediation
5. **Recovery**: Secure restoration of services
6. **Lessons Learned**: Post-incident review and improvements

## Security Updates

- Security updates are released as soon as possible
- Critical vulnerabilities are addressed within 24-48 hours
- Users are notified through multiple channels
- Detailed security advisories are published
