- Implement minimum code to pass tests
- Focus on functionality over optimization
- Ensure all tests pass consistently
- Maintain test coverage throughout implementation

### Phase 3: REFACTOR (Optimization)
- Optimize code for performance
- Improve code structure and maintainability
- Add advanced features beyond basic requirements
- Ensure tests continue to pass after refactoring
