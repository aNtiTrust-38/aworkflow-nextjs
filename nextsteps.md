# Cursor Session Summary (2025-07-12)

## Summary of Cursor Chat
- Reviewed project rules: .inviolate-cursor-rules.md, .tdd-rules-cursor.md, .yolo_cursor_rules.md
- Confirmed TDD and YOLO protocols are in effect for this milestone
- Identified next focus: user-settings-storage and API endpoint test failures (per previous sprint notes)
- Ran full test suite: 3 test files failed, 35 tests failed, 208 passed, 1 skipped (out of 244)
- Confirmed test failures remain in user-settings-storage and API endpoints

## Blockers
- Multiple test failures (35) remain, especially in user-settings-storage and API endpoints
- Some failures may be due to edge cases, async issues, or incomplete error handling
- Need detailed failure output to prioritize fixes

## State of Development
- Navigation component: Fully functional, all tests passing, accessibility confirmed
- Test suite: Majority of tests passing, but critical failures remain in settings-related modules
- TDD/YOLO rules are being followed for all new work
- No regressions in Navigation or related components
- Development environment and dependencies are functional

## Next Steps to Complete This Milestone
1. Run tests with verbose output to identify specific failing tests and error messages
2. Prioritize and fix user-settings-storage and API endpoint test failures
3. Ensure all tests pass (no skipped or failing tests)
4. Refactor and clean up code as needed, maintaining TDD discipline
5. Update documentation and nextsteps.md with progress
6. Confirm milestone completion with all tests green and no regressions
