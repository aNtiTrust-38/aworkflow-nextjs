## 🔧 Known Minor Issues (Non-blocking)

### Low Priority Items
1. **Build trace collection timeout** - Likely environment-specific, doesn't affect functionality
2. **Test Observer API compatibility** - Only affects test environment, not production
3. **Minor style assertion failures** - Cosmetic test issues only

These issues do not impact production functionality or user experience.
