#### **Step 3: File Browser Interface (Day 2)**
- **Complete**: File browser UI components and interactions
- **Test**: File selection, management, and preview functionality
- **Implement**: File operations (delete, rename, move)
- **Add**: File search and filtering capabilities

### **Phase 2: Infrastructure Optimization (Days 3-4)**
*Priority: Resolve remaining build/test performance issues*

#### **Step 1: Build System Optimization (Day 3)**
- **Implement**: Webpack performance optimizations in next.config.ts
- **Add**: Build caching and incremental compilation
- **Optimize**: ESLint configuration for faster linting
- **Target**: Reduce build time from 3 minutes to 30-45 seconds

#### **Step 2: Test Infrastructure Enhancement (Day 3-4)**
- **Implement**: Separate test configurations (vitest.node.config.ts vs vitest.jsdom.config.ts)
- **Enable**: Parallel test execution and optimize test collection
- **Add**: Proper test categorization (fast/medium/slow)
- **Target**: Full test suite under 2 minutes

#### **Step 3: Configuration Cleanup (Day 4)**
- **Archive**: Experimental configurations (10+ unused configs)
- **Establish**: Single working test setup
- **Document**: Configuration choices and rationale

### **Phase 3: Production Preparation (Day 5)**
*Priority: Ready for Phase 3A transition*

#### **Step 1: Quality Assurance**
- **Run**: Comprehensive test suite for all file management features
- **Verify**: Build and deployment process stability
- **Validate**: Performance improvements and benchmarks
- **Test**: File management integration with existing workflow

#### **Step 2: Documentation Updates**
- **Update**: README with file management feature documentation
- **Correct**: Completion percentages to reflect actual progress
- **Update**: nextsteps.md with accurate development status
- **Prepare**: Comprehensive Phase 3A transition plan

## üîß **Technical Details and Implementation**

### **Current Branch: v1.7-beta-file-management**
- **Focus**: File upload, folder management, and browser interface
- **Status**: 60% complete, actively being developed
- **Key Components**: FileBrowser, FileUploadZone, FolderManager
- **API Endpoints**: `/api/files/upload.ts`, `/api/folders.ts`

### **Infrastructure Improvements Made**
