# Next Steps: Academic Workflow Project (Sprint Summary)

## Recent Sprint Summary (December 2024)
**Focus:** Resolving TDD blocking issues and stabilizing test suite
**Approach:** Systematic debugging and component fixes to unblock development workflow

### Key Accomplishments ✅

1. **SetupWizard Component Fixes**
   - ✅ Fixed API key testing with proper safety checks (`details?.message`)
   - ✅ Resolved duplicate heading accessibility issues in Review & Complete step
   - ✅ Improved test mocking for step navigation and validation
   - ✅ Enhanced error handling for undefined test result properties

2. **ProgressBar Component Stability**
   - ✅ Fixed precision issues in percentage calculations (rounded to 2 decimal places)
   - ✅ Resolved division by zero edge case when min equals max
   - ✅ All test assertions now pass reliably

3. **Navigation Component Improvements**
   - ✅ Updated API key validation logic (at least one key required vs both)
   - ✅ Improved API health check flow for better user experience
   - ✅ Enhanced usage indicator display logic

4. **Development Infrastructure**
   - ✅ Added cursor rules files to `.claude/commands/` for better AI assistance
   - ✅ Maintained test performance (~12s runtime)
   - ✅ Resolved critical blocking issues that prevented Cursor from progressing

## Current State

### Test Suite Status
- **Performance**: ~12 seconds runtime (optimized from previous >475s)
- **Coverage**: Core components have comprehensive test coverage
- **Stability**: Major flaky/brittle tests resolved
- **Status**: Primary blocking issues resolved, some minor API mock timing issues remain

### Component Status
- **SetupWizard**: ✅ Robust navigation, validation, and error handling
- **ProgressBar**: ✅ Reliable calculations and edge case handling  
- **Navigation**: ✅ Improved usage indicators and API health checks
- **User Settings**: ✅ Functional with proper encryption/storage

### Technical Debt Addressed
- ✅ Duplicate heading accessibility violations
- ✅ Unsafe property access in test result display
- ✅ Precision issues in progress calculations
- ✅ API key validation logic inconsistencies
