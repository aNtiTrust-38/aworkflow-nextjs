# Phase 5 Progress & Next Steps

## Summary of Work Completed

- **Real AI API Integration:**
  - Refactored `/api/generate` endpoint to robustly handle provider availability and fail fast with clear errors if no API key is configured.
  - Ensured provider instantiation and router creation throw immediately if no valid API key is present.
  - Fixed a bug where provider availability checks were performed on provider names (strings) instead of instances.
  - Added test isolation: global AI router cache is now reset after each test, ensuring correct fail-fast behavior and no stale state.
  - All `/api/generate` endpoint tests now pass, including the RED test for real provider integration (500 error with correct message when no provider is configured).

- **Test-Driven Development (TDD):**
  - Strict TDD enforced: every change driven by a failing test, followed by implementation and refactor.
  - YOLO commit rules followed: commit after every passing test.
  - Test coverage and error handling improved for API integration.

- **Error Handling & Robustness:**
  - Improved error messages for missing/invalid API keys.
  - Ensured API fails fast and returns actionable errors for misconfiguration.

## Current Project Status

- **UI:** Stable, all major UI tests pass, accessibility and ADHD-friendly improvements in place.
- **API:** `/api/generate` endpoint is robust, testable, and ready for real provider integration.
- **Test Suite:** All tests passing, including edge cases for provider configuration and error handling.
- **Code Quality:** High coverage, strict TypeScript, ESLint clean, robust error handling.
- **Unblocked:** Real provider integration and advanced features can now proceed with confidence.

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Real Provider Integration:**
   - Enable and test with real Anthropic/OpenAI API keys in dev/staging.
   - Add tests for real content generation, cost tracking, and provider selection logic.
   - Implement and test fallback and cost optimization logic in the router.

2. **Data Persistence & User Settings:**
   - Persist user settings, API keys, and preferences securely (encrypted at rest).
   - Add UI for managing provider keys and settings.

3. **Advanced Academic Features:**
   - AI-powered research assistant, plagiarism detection, and template system.
   - Enhanced citation management and export customization.

4. **Performance & Scalability:**
   - Code splitting, caching, and PWA enhancements.
   - Optimize for production performance and reliability.

5. **UX Enhancements:**
   - Onboarding flow, collaboration features, and version control for documents.
   - Continue accessibility and ADHD-friendly improvements.

6. **Production Readiness:**
   - Finalize error recovery, logging, and monitoring.
   - Prepare for deployment and user onboarding.
