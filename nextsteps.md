# Sprint Summary: Test Refactor & SetupWizard Fixes (July 2024)

## Current State of Development
- Major test refactor in progress: consolidating test utilities, improving reliability, and increasing coverage.
- Navigation and SetupWizard components updated for accessibility (all step titles now use semantic headings).
- Test matchers updated for robust heading/title detection.
- Navigation usage indicator bug fixed; all related tests pass.
- SetupWizard tests: most pass after matcher and heading fixes, but a few step navigation/validation issues remain.
- TDD and documentation cycle enforced via `.cursor/scratchpad.md`.

## Next Steps
1. **Finish SetupWizard Test Pass**
   - Debug and fix remaining step navigation/validation test failures.
   - Ensure all step transitions and validations are covered and robust.
2. **Remove Redundant/Flaky Tests**
   - Audit for obsolete or flaky tests and clean up.
3. **Optimize Test Performance**
   - Refactor slow tests, improve setup/teardown, and parallelize where possible.
4. **Generate and Document Coverage Report**
   - Run coverage, document gaps, and plan for 100% critical path coverage.
5. **Update Documentation**
   - Summarize changes and lessons learned in `.cursor/scratchpad.md` and project docs.
