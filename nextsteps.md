**Objective**: Standardize authentication across all endpoints

**Tasks**:
1. **Fix API Test Authentication Setup**
   - Resolve getServerSession mocking in existing tests
   - Ensure consistent authentication patterns across `/api/folders`, `/api/files/upload`
   - Fix test failures related to 401 unauthorized responses

2. **Implement Proper Error Handling**
   - Standardize error response formats across endpoints
   - Add proper logging with security considerations
   - Implement rate limiting and input validation

#### **Phase 2B: Database Connection Optimization (Days 8-9)**
**Objective**: Ensure reliable database operations under load

**Tasks**:
1. **Connection Pool Management**
   - Optimize Prisma client connection handling
   - Implement proper connection cleanup
   - Add database health checks

2. **File Upload System Reliability**
   - Fix formidable parsing issues in upload tests
   - Implement proper file validation and storage
   - Add storage quota enforcement

### 🛠️ **Technical Implementation Plan**

#### **Priority 1: Fix Authentication Mocking (Immediate)**
```typescript
// Current issue: getServerSession mock not working correctly
// Fix: Update test setup in __tests__/api/ files
```

#### **Priority 2: Standardize Error Responses**
```typescript
// Implement consistent error response format
interface APIError {
  error: string;
  code: string;
  details?: string[];
}
```

#### **Priority 3: Database Performance**
- Optimize query patterns in folder hierarchy operations
- Implement proper transaction handling for file uploads
- Add connection monitoring and health checks

### 📋 **Success Criteria for Phase 2**

**Completion Requirements:**
- [ ] All existing API tests passing (currently 0/23 in files-upload, 0/4 in folders)
- [ ] Proper authentication working across all endpoints
- [ ] Consistent error handling and logging
- [ ] File upload system working with storage quotas
- [ ] Database operations optimized for performance

**Quality Gates:**
- [ ] No API endpoint returning undefined/null errors
- [ ] All authentication tests passing
- [ ] Error responses following standard format
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met for database operations

### 🔧 **Development Methodology (Continued)**
