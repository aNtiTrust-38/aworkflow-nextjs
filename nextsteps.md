# Sprint Summary - SetupWizard Test Stabilization (2025-07-12)

## Sprint Accomplishments

### Major Blockers Addressed âœ…
- **SetupWizard integration and async test failures:**
  - Fixed issues with multiple elements matching the same role/name (e.g., "Continue" buttons, progressbars) during rapid navigation and async state changes.
  - Refactored component and tests to use `data-testid` and robust queries (`getAllByTestId`, function matchers for text/headings).
  - Patched all async and accessibility tests to handle DOM structure changes and edge cases.
- **Test reliability:**
  - Improved test isolation and async handling.
  - All SetupWizard tests now robust to rapid navigation, async state, and accessibility requirements.

### Performance Metrics
- **Test failures reduced:** SetupWizard test failures dropped to zero for integration/async issues.
- **Passing tests increased:** All SetupWizard tests now pass, with improved reliability.

## Current State of Development

### Test Suite Status âœ…
- **SetupWizard:** All integration, async, and accessibility tests pass.
- **ApiKeyTester:** Next priority for real-time validation and feedback test stabilization.
- **Overall:** 223/244 tests passing (91.4% pass rate). Remaining failures are mostly in ApiKeyTester and a few edge integration cases.

### Architecture Status âœ…
- **Component rendering:** Only one set of navigation/progress elements rendered at a time.
- **Test queries:** All tests use robust selectors and function matchers for async/DOM edge cases.

### Development Environment âœ…
- **Dependencies:** All packages functional and up to date.
- **Testing framework:** Vitest configuration optimized and working.
- **Git workflow:** Changes committed and pushed successfully.
- **TDD/YOLO protocols:** Maintained throughout the sprint.

## Remaining Blockers
- **ApiKeyTester:**
  - Real-time validation and feedback tests still flaky or failing due to async/timing issues.
  - Needs similar refactor as SetupWizard for robust test selectors and async handling.
- **A few edge integration tests:**
  - Some integration tests for rapid user actions or error states still need patching.

## Next Steps to Finish This Sprint
1. **Stabilize ApiKeyTester tests:**
   - Refactor component and tests to use robust selectors and async patterns.
   - Ensure all real-time validation and feedback tests pass reliably.
2. **Patch remaining edge integration tests:**
   - Use function matchers and `getAllBy*` queries for any async/DOM edge cases.
3. **Full test suite run:**
   - Confirm 100% pass rate and no regressions.
4. **Document lessons learned and update sprint summary.**

**Sprint Status:** ðŸŸ¡ **IN PROGRESS** - SetupWizard stabilized, ApiKeyTester and edge cases next.
