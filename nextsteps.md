# Sprint Summary & Next Steps

## Sprint Accomplishments
- Added comprehensive TDD edge case tests for SetupWizard: partial completion, corrupted/missing settings, rapid navigation, and accessibility (ARIA/keyboard).
- Implemented partial fixes: navigation lock, defensive API parsing, and rendering refactor to reduce DOM duplication.
- All changes committed with detailed test results and blockers.

## Current State
- Core SetupWizard functionality is robust for normal flows.
- Edge case tests for rapid navigation and accessibility still fail due to React rendering multiple progressbars/buttons during fast transitions.
- 12 tests passing, 17 failing (all failures are new edge/rapid navigation tests; no regressions in core flows).
- No regressions in user settings, navigation, or API health checks.

## Blockers
- React renders multiple step containers during rapid navigation, causing duplicate progressbars and navigation buttons in the DOM.
- Existing navigation lock and rendering refactor are not sufficient to prevent DOM duplication under test conditions.
- Further architectural or state management changes may be required to fully resolve this.

## Next Steps
1. Investigate and implement a stricter navigation lock or transition state to guarantee only one step is rendered at a time.
2. Explore alternative approaches (e.g., unmounting previous step content, using portals, or state queueing) to prevent DOM duplication.
3. Continue TDD: update tests and implementation until all edge case tests pass.
4. Once SetupWizard is stable, proceed to expand ErrorBoundary and Navigation usage indicator tests as planned.
